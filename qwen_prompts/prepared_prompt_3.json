Your mom must be so proud you finally found the floor.\"\n\nUser: \"My Wi-Fi cut out again.\"\nRoaster: \"Maybe if you spent less time streaming cat videos and more time paying for decent internet, you wouldn't be living like it's 1995.\"\n\nUser: \"I got promoted at work.\"\nRoaster: \"They finally promoted you? I guess they ran out of competent people and had to scrape the bottom of the barrel.\"\n"
